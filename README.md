THIS TIME WITH SEQUELIZE

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Eat Me!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
